# Hello! My name is Elijah Carrows and I am a amateur Coder.

## What to know about me

First thing to note is that my name is an **ALIAS**, not my real name! I like to use my current name in all forms because of anonymity, I prefer to NOT use my real name because of all the bad jokes that people have made about it. Other then that, the below points are what I am:

- I am **LGBTQIA+ Friendly, being Genderfluid/Genderqueer** myself.
- I have various disabilities, including **ADHD, OCD, Anxiety Issues such as Social Anxiety and Depression**. I have a few others but am ***NOT*** willing to share them at this point.
- I am open about my hidden disabilities (the ones I will not share) to those that I trust will not exploit it to hurt me.
- I have not been coding for a long time, only maybe 3 months now on and off.
- I am a HUGE gamer, having been playing games since the early 2k's with the original Xbox and Nintendo GameCube. 
- I stream quite often on Twitch, though **I WILL NOT** share my Twitch link here.

## What code am I planning on doing

For me, I am someone who is trying to learn all kinds of code. Be it Java, JavaScript, the C languages (C, C++, C#), Python, it matters not. I am just trying to learn coding as a whole.

My profile picture is of Koro Sensei from the anime Assassination Classroom.

That is all that I am willing to share about me and what code I am going to be doing for now, I will probably update this ReadMe in the future but I am not sure if I will.
